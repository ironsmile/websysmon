== About

Here's the situation. You are some sort of web dev. Now, there is this evil sysadmin who won't let you ssh to the server to monitor its cpu/ram usage. What do you do? You make yourself an web system monitor with fancy interface ofc. That's the one I bundled. 

== Contents

3 files - the interface file (index.php), the info harvesting file (info.php) and prototype.js (because I am way too lazy)

== Requirements

An Unixy server and PHP.
